This repository contains projects completed by me for learning and demonstration purposes.

- **Movie Recommendation System** : In this project, I created a movie recommendation system that uses the [MovieLens 25M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) which contains movie reviews, users and over 25 million ratings. In this system the user search an specific movie title in the data and it recommend specific movies similar to the movie searched using user-based collaborative filtering.
